### Verification
```bash
$ pnpm why path-to-regexp
dependencies:
express 5.1.0
└─┬ router 2.2.0
  └── path-to-regexp 8.2.0  ✅ SAFE VERSION

$ grep "path-to-regexp" pnpm-lock.yaml
path-to-regexp@8.2.0:  ✅ Locked to safe version
```

### Actions Taken
1. ✅ Verified `path-to-regexp@8.2.0` in production dependencies
2. ✅ Removed extraneous packages with vulnerable versions
3. ✅ Clean reinstall of node_modules (`rm -rf node_modules && pnpm install`)
4. ✅ Build tested successfully - all routes functional
