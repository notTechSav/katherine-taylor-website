              A client once sent two lines: in-suite only, three hours, no celebrity
              talk. Most people would see red flags. I saw the date—Gateway
              Conference, same week last year at the Four Seasons. I saw the
              precision—three hours meant no dinner break. I saw the
              subtext—he’d had a bad experience and wanted efficiency, privacy, and
              a conversation with substance. I arrived discreetly at seven, no
              instructions needed. That’s what institutional memory looks like when
              it’s in practice.

              My work sits at the intersection of strategic counsel and personal
              continuity. Half of what I do is high-level thinking—pattern
              recognition, operational clarity, risk sorting. The other half is
              presence—listening until I can hear the sentence you didn’t finish.
              The outcome is relief: you don’t have to explain yourself to be
              understood.
            </p>
            <p>
              I keep a small roster so every relationship stays alive in my head.
              Each engagement builds on the last; by the third, we’re operating at
              full depth. Decisions move faster, and the conversations reach a level
              most people never get to have.
            </p>
            <p>
              I work with C-suite executives, IPO founders, and family-office
              principals who already have brilliant advisors but no one who
              remembers the whole picture—the professional, the personal, and the
              quiet space in between. That’s the gap I fill.
            </p>
            <p>
              I don’t advertise availability because capacity is limited by design.
              When I reach twenty active partnerships, I raise rates rather than add
              more names. If continuity matters to you, reach out before the next
              review window.
