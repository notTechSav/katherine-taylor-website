        <h2>On Gifts</h2>
        <p className="mt-4">Gifts aren't expected—they're punctuation, not purpose. I don't need leather goods or jewelry. What I value: rare wine (I collect Burgundy), first-edition books (philosophy, art theory), or contributions to the SF-Marin Food Bank in my name. But truly—your presence and respect matter more than any object.</p>

        <h2>Continuity as Craft</h2>
        <p className="mt-4">The conversation never resets. I remember your M&A timeline, your Napa recommendations, the Rothko exhibition we discussed. This isn't scripted—it's built on actual continuity. Whether we meet quarterly or annually, I hold the thread.</p>

        <p className="mt-4">After a decade at the highest tier of this industry, I've learned that transparency builds trust. I've written 26 answers to questions most companions avoid: screening, boundaries, logistics, philosophy. If you're vetting carefully, start here.</p>

        <h2>The City</h2>
        <p className="mt-4">Where I spend most of my time with clients. Not the tourist SF—the SF of hidden staircases in Pacific Heights, natural wine bars in the Inner Sunset, and pre-dawn walks through the Presidio. I'll show you the version most people miss.</p>
